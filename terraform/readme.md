# Terraform Structure

To allow for easier editing of code the bulk of the Terraform code is in a seperate git repository.  We'll reference this module repository and pass in different variables from this repo based on the requested environment.

TODO: We still need to design a git promotion strategy to move from dev to testing to production.
